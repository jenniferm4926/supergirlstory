        <h2><span style="color:#a54dff">How it came to be</h2>
        <p>Ammie was having a horrible day, she had just gotten into an argument with her friends, she had a pile of exams and homework waiting for her and to make matters worse, it started to rain. She was walking home, kicking small pebbles and overall
            very unhappy. All of a sudden the girl kicks a rock instead of a pebble with too much force that it goes into the bush and some boy yells "OW". Feeling very embarassed she goes to apologize, the rock hit a young man that was laying on the
            ground. Ammie thought he was a bit weird, who would be out here in this rain? The young man rubs his head and grins at her. He tells her "it's no problem". Still embaressed she turns to leave when the boy grabs her wrist and hands her a necklace.
            He says I have no use for it and it would look better on a pretty girl like you. Ammie mutters a quick thank you and this time leaves home. Once she's arrived home and all her work is completed, she can't help that her mind travels to the
            boy she met after school. Remembering the necklace, she takes it out of her pocket and decides to wear it. Everything seemed normal at first .. the days to come would prove her wrong. She woke up one morning and she was floating AND the necklace
            seemd to glow! In the afternoon she was fustrated with a math problem and her hands turned purple and <span style="color:red">BURNED </span> it up.The next few days more unusual things would unfold. Her little joke is that shes a future superhero
            and her super name is <span style="color:#6d00e6">Amethystia</span>. She's not so sure of whats going to happen, you'll have to watch to find out yourself.
