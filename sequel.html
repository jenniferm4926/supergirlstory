      <h1>What <span style="color: #a54dff">happens</span> next?</h1>
<p>Amethystia is actually enjoying her powers. Everyday she rushes home in order to test them out alittle more. She's having trouble controlling them. Her emotions often get the best of her. She starts dreaming of helping people and becoming a superhero! She thinks she won't be of any use if she can't control them. She knows the boy is the only hope if she wants her dreams to come true. Ammie knows he's still in town, he seems like a good guy, she believes it is him who is making the news with his acts to help the community. Only the mystery man can create Amethystia. The question is, will she ever find him? </p>
